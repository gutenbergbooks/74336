<h2 class="nobreak">FOR THE DEFENCE OF CANADA</h2>
</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>There is no serious suggestion among British people
that Great Britain could have remained neutral in the
Great War which broke across Europe three years ago and
which still fills the earth with devastation and mourning.
By British people one means not only those of English
speech and British origin, but all of any race or tongue or
creed who salute the flag, and enjoy the heritage of freedom
which belongs to British citizenship. The mother
country had an understanding with France which could
not be ignored; an obligation to Belgium which could not
be repudiated without dishonor. In the conventions and
understandings to which the British Empire was committed
there was no menace to any other nation. The
object was not to make war but to keep peace; not to
divide or convulse Europe but to assure international
security and the honorable and happy independence of
all peoples.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It is true that the British navy was maintained in
strength, vigor and efficiency, but the navy was not an
instrument of aggression nor even the guardian of exclusive
paths for British commerce across the seas. It was
the bulwark of freedom; the police force of all nations.
The trade of the Empire had no other protection. The
Empire itself had no other wall of defence. There was no
British army to challenge other communities nor any
thought of aggression or conquest. Indeed it is certain
that the people of Great Britain and the Dominions could
not be united in support of a war for territorial extension
or a wanton attack upon the independence of any other
country. There may be doubtful chapters in British
history. There may have been ages when Great Britain
was willing to live by the sword; when her statesmen
strove for dominion over other lands and peoples. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
with the Victorian era a new spirit entered into British
councils. Her statesmen thought of the sword only as a
necessary guarantee of British security. They gave
earnest support to all movements designed to settle international
differences by conciliation and arbitration.
They were so “slow to anger” that envious and restless
neighbors persuaded themselves that the old might and
puissance of Imperial Britain had gone forever.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>There is no better evidence of the purity of British
motives and the disinterestedness of British action than
the complete unity of the Empire in the desperate struggle
in which it is now engaged. If there could be better
evidence it lies in the fact that the United States, removed
for a century from the quarrels of Europe, has entered the
conflict, in sheer revolt against Teutonic aggression and
driven by a noble impatience with actions that have
destroyed the reign of law among nations and put earth
and heaven to shame. Thus we have not only the British
people, so seldom united in war, animated by a common
purpose, but also the American Republic, nurtured in
love of peace and distrustful of the old world’s ideals and
ambitions, inspired and united by a common sense of
danger and a common concern for freedom and civilization.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It was manifest even before war was declared that
there would be no indecision or division in Canada. We
knew that with the mother country at war we would be at
war. We could not be neutral and remain within the
Empire. There was no apprehension of compulsion by
the Imperial Government. There was certainty of compulsion
by Germany if our attitude was not defined and
unequivocal. We had to proclaim independence and
neutrality or pledge our manhood and resources to maintain
the security and integrity of the Empire. If we had
done otherwise than we have we would now be skulking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
in the world’s byways and writhing under the contempt
of decent peoples. Who suggests that in time of peace
we can sing God save the King, boast of our British
citizenship and send our trade on the seas under protection
of the British navy, and do nothing in time of war?
There could, however, be no greater mistake than to
think that we are in the war at the command of Great
Britain or purely to sustain British interests. We are in
the war primarily to defend and maintain freedom and
self-government in Canada. At least Great Britain is
fighting for Canada as surely as Canada is fighting for
Great Britain.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>It is almost inconceivable that Germany could have
doubted what our decision would be. We acted involuntarily
and instinctively. There was unanimity in the
press and in Parliament. We did not think of degrees of
obligation or conditions of alliance. In Quebec there was
rejoicing over the compact between Britain and France,
while in the English provinces we saw national and
Imperial value in a union of French and English, in defence
of free institutions. We believed that through the common
sacrifices of war would come that happy understanding
between the races in Canada which has been the
aspiration of Canadian patriots for a century. We took
deep satisfaction in the prospect that France, in alliance
with Britain, would emerge from a long humiliation with
the “lost provinces” recovered and the ancient national
dignity restored. Hence we said to the mother country
as Jehoshaphat said to the King of Israel, “I am as thou
art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee
in the war.” For her as for us the choice was between
sacrifice and dishonor, and when these are the conditions
honor and sacrifice are the immemorial obligation and
inheritance of the British people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>No one foresaw the duration or the magnitude of the
conflict. Armageddon was a vision of poets and prophets.
The 20th century, inspired by enthusiasts and instructed
by economists, believed that the world had grown soft
and “practical.” We were told that war lords were
legendary figures of an evil past. It was a common belief
that no nation could command the resources for a long
struggle. It was said that finance and commerce, interlocked
and internationalized, would compel a speedy
cessation of hostilities by exhaustion of the combatants.
We were assured that the industrial armies of the workshops
could not be mobilized for mutual destruction. To
the few who were wiser we would not listen. Possibly
much of their wisdom was rooted in apprehension and
suspicion. There never was so much of mercy and
charity and goodwill and brotherhood among men as
during the first years of the century. We had the Hague
tribunal and treaties of arbitration. We had international
law and worldwide organizations for the common protection
and enrichment of mankind. It is not strange,
therefore, if men believed that there was a happy prospect
of enduring peace or if there was general impatience with
those who spoke of war and preparation for war.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>It is not necessary to consider at length the immediate
causes of the war or to marshal the evidence in proof of
Great Britain’s disinterested and resolute endeavor to
avert the conflict. Few of the great wars of history
stand the cold, unimpassioned scrutiny of later generations.
We have, however, overwhelming evidence that
Germany plotted and prepared for sovereignty in Europe
and an unchallenged primacy among the nations. The
world has been astounded by the revelation of German
motives, the inflexible persistence of German policy, the
extent and efficiency of German preparation. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
only by the mercy of God and the martyrdom of Belgium
that France was not brought to her knees before she
could organize her valiant defence or the heroic British
regiments unite with the French legions to check the
advance on Paris. While time lasts the betrayal of
Belgium will have shameful pre-eminence in what John
Morley calls “The sombre tragedy of human history.”
Nor would Great Britain have escaped lasting dishonor
if she had failed in fidelity to France and Belgium at any
cost of life and treasure. It is not necessary to argue
that the violation of Belgian neutrality alone explains the
British declaration of war upon Germany. That cause
was adequate, if there were no other, but there were other
considerations of direct and tremendous consequence to
the British Empire.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Looking to the future British statesmen could not
doubt that Germany, triumphant over France and
Belgium, with power of dictation over Russia, with
mastery of Turkey, and with Vienna in subjection
to Berlin, would organize its resources and consolidate
its energies for an attack upon Britain and her Dominions.
Indeed all that has been disclosed shows clearly that the
destruction of Great Britain and partial or complete
suzerainty over the self-governing British nations was the
ultimate object of German policy. With a land army
unequalled in Europe the Kaiser set himself to rival the
British navy and the British merchant marine. A great
navy was not required to ensure the political security or
protect the commerce of Germany. Only by naval
power could the British Empire exist. When we think of
the achievements of the Germanic alliance against a world
in arms we realize what a mortal hazard the British
Empire would have faced in single combat against
enemies enriched by the spoils of victory over France,
Russia and Belgium, and with all the smaller nations of
Europe reduced to submissive neutrality. It was vital,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
therefore, that Britain should enter the struggle not only
by virtue of honorable alliances but to guard her very
existence. Moreover, if Britain had hesitated at the
outset it is certain that her position would quickly have
become intolerable. In a few weeks or months she would
have had to send her fleet to sea and organize her manhood
for defence. Delay, resulting from foolish confidence
or timid counsels, would have been dangerous and
possibly fatal to all the vital interests which depend upon
a solvent and powerful British Commonwealth.</p>

<div class="verse">An hour may lay it in the dust.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Whether or not there was lack of vigilance or failure
in preparation by Great Britain, there is nothing more
remarkable in human history than the achievements of
the British people in the war. Few doubted that the
navy would be vigilant and invincible. It was not feared
that the old historic regiments would fail in valor or
endurance. But there is nothing even in British annals
so wonderful as the voluntary enlistment of an army
of four millions. If only as a measure of the danger
which threatened the Empire the figures are impressive.
Men would not have recruited in hundreds of thousands
if they had not felt that the institutions they cherished,
even their very households, stood in the shadow of death.
No doubt a flame of wrath swept over England as the
revolting story of German brutality in Belgium was unfolded,
but a living, conscious sense of actual danger to
the Empire was the moving impulse to British action.
The tremendous voluntary enlistment is only rivalled as
a phenomenon in British history by the final adoption of
the principle of compulsory service. It was not only in
Canada that this method of recruiting was regarded with
disfavor. For generations compulsion for military service
has been repugnant to the genius of British institutions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
It was held to be the essential basis of the militarism of
continental countries. The conviction or prejudice which
obtained in England was as deeply rooted in the United
States. A great standing army was treated in both
countries as incompatible with the ideals of a free people.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>In framing the constitution the fathers of the American
Republic were chiefly concerned to repose power in
Congress and to establish conditions under which a
military dictatorship would be forever impossible. Across
the world for a century fell the shadow of Napoleon.
Behind stood the sinister figures of ancient dictators and
despots. During the American Civil War the draft produced
disaffection and riot in the North, while Lincoln
was permitted to exercise autocratic power because he
held his authority from “the people.” There was confusion
of thinking through facts of history which had no
validity under democracy, and sincere devotion to theories
and prejudices which challenge the basic ideals and
principles of popular government. A writer in The
London Times Literary Supplement, discussing “The
ways of Revolution,” said, “In modern times democracy
has almost invariably had the best of the fighting. France
herself was never led to defeat by a Republican Government;
Waterloo and Sedan were lost by her Emperors.
Swiss history is one long tale of democratic success in
defence; two Dutch provinces defied the arms of
Philip II., and thirteen American colonies the might of
the British Empire. Democracy is more prone to suicide
than liable to conquest.”</p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>It is idle to suggest that compulsion should have been
applied in Great Britain when the war began. The certain
result would have been resistance and disorder. The
nation would have been weakened, divided, disabled for
the mighty task before it. Only actual experience and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the undesirable consequences of unregulated enlistment
established the necessity for selection and made compulsory
service possible. Railway workers, coal miners and
various classes of skilled mechanics had to be brought
back from the trenches. It was found necessary to
reserve and organize labor for the shipyards and the
munition factories. Agriculture had to be stimulated to
the utmost. For a time there was a degree of industrial
confusion, and under-production of essential war materials
because men had joined the colors who could give better
service to the Empire in the shops and mines than they
could give in the field. It was essential that transportation
should be efficient and the armies well fed and well
equipped if battles were to be won against the long preparation,
the scientific machinery and the accumulated
war stores of Germany. Hence selection became necessary
in order that the industrial forces should be competent
and adequate and organized to secure the maximum of
production. Unexpected revelations of German brutality
and ruthlessness affected the thinking of multitudes of
the British people. They began to realize that all the
energies and resources of the kingdom must be employed
if victory over the Germanic alliance was to be achieved.
There was reason to rejoice over the results of voluntary
recruiting. What had been done was magnificent. But
it was recognized that there was still man-power available
and that the situation required the enrolment of every
citizen who was physically equal to military service, and
engaged in activities less vital to the security of the State.
Great Britain adopted every expedient to secure recruits
before the selective draft was applied. It was found that
the voluntary system was costly, partial and undemocratic.
Enlistment was uncertain, haphazard and uneven.
Many incidents, when appeals for recruits became strident
and coercive, were repugnant to national self-respect and
national dignity. Through adversity Great Britain discovered
that equality of service and sacrifice is the essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
basis of democracy. Under the system of National
Service there is no distinction of race or creed or class
or position. There is restriction upon freedom but only
that the State may be preserved and the citizen secured
in life and liberty, under the flag of his choice and in the
land of his fathers.</p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>In the light of history the ready submission of the
United States to compulsory draft when peace with
Germany could no longer be maintained is remarkable.
If the Republic had been among the original combatants
it is inconceivable that the draft at the outset would have
been sanctioned. There is nothing in the history of the
Revolutionary War, the war of 1812 or the Civil War to
suggest that the United States would raise armies by
compulsion while the forces required could be secured by
the voluntary system. Nearly three years elapsed before
the statesmen at Washington resolved to engage in the
great struggle between freedom and despotism. It is not
necessarily a reproach to the American people that there
was long delay before friendly relations with Germany
were severed. A divided nation cannot strike with all
its strength. Until the people were substantially united
compulsion was impracticable and dangerous. Through
the patience and wise dealing of the President and the
arrogance, insolence and devious manœuvring of Germany
a common national feeling was finally developed upon
which Mr. Wilson could rely for support in all measures
necessary to secure appropriations, raise armies and
ensure sympathetic and effective co-operation between
the Government and the people. Supported by the
national feeling the President was able to establish
national service and save his country from the waste,
strain, clamor and inequity of raising armies by voluntary
appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>The United States was in a position to profit by the
experiences of Britain and Canada. It had knowledge of
the disadvantages of the voluntary system as revealed in
the British countries and freedom from the illusions
which delayed and embarrassed the original combatants.
We hardly yet realize what a revolution in opinion was
necessary before the draft could be applied in Britain or
the United States. We have a new revelation in democracy
which would have come slowly, if at all, if the war
had gone more prosperously for the Allies. It would not
have come had the war ended in one or two campaigns.
Sheer military necessity chiefly explains the change in
popular feeling. At least in Britain and Canada the
demand for compulsion became so general and formidable
that the Governments could not resist. Jean Jaures, an
extreme Socialist and idealist, argues that the rooted
objection to national service which has been so common
in democratic countries finds its support in the spirit
of caste and the vested interests of a class who cling
to the idea of commanding a great army, segregated
from the nation in a world of its own, with its own laws,
its own pomp and circumstance, rather than of accepting
their position as the leading citizens in an armed nation.
He insists that “just as there is no power more majestic
than that of the national will embodied in law, so there is
no army more powerful and more capable of endowing its
leaders with moral authority and prestige, if they are in
harmony with it, than an army which is the armed nation
itself, inspired with the determination to defend its
independence and organized for the purpose.” Events
justify Jaures and go far to establish national service as
the sound and necessary military system for a democracy
at war. The feeling that the army necessarily constitutes
a separate class is dying. So is the idea that only those
who choose to bear arms are responsible for the national
safety. Passing, too, is the notion which divides armies
into free men and “conscripts” and regards compulsory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
national service as destructive of individual freedom and
personal independence.</p>

<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>Napoleon conscripted for aggression and conquest.
Under National Service Republican France has had
freedom from internal convulsions and Chauvinistic
military adventures. In defence the French people have
made sacrifices of blood and treasure beyond computation.
But for nearly half a century, notwithstanding the brutal
arrogance and avarice of Prussia in 1870, they kept the
peace themselves and were among the active forces for
peace in the councils of Europe. In Germany national
service is not the “Will of the people,” but the instrument
of rulers lusting for dominion and intolerant of the privileges
and ideals of democracy. If France had trusted to
the voluntary system she would have been overcome in
1914, before her forces could have been organized to resist
the German attack. We reach false conclusions because
we think of the origin of “conscription” rather than of the
equity of national service. A democracy chooses its
rulers; an autocracy commands its subjects. In France
and Germany we have the conflicting ideals of an autocracy
organized for attack and a democracy organized for
defence. A looser military organization in France would
have ensured the success of the attack. Failure to arm
the nation would have been equivalent to self-destruction.
Where the power to command, without assent of the
people, exists, democracy has not come to birth. Where
democracy rejects the supreme obligation of citizenship
it is not full born. One may not think that the world
must “stand to arms” forever but until the free democracies
develop the power and the spirit to disarm autocracies
and command peace, enduring peace will not prevail.
Whether or not any league of nations will ever “fight for
peace” only the gods know. From the welter of blood
and ruin upon which we look to-day it would be a dark
prospect if we could not cherish the vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>As has been said there was no thought of a draft in
Canada when the war began. The press and the political
leaders gave many assurances that compulsion would not
be employed. It was assumed that the response to the
appeal of the Department of Militia would be adequate.
There was a common expectation that the war would not
last for twelve months and that at most Canada would
provide an army of 50,000 or 100,000. In the first months
of war more men offered themselves that we could arm
and equip. In the course of ten weeks over 30,000 had
embarked at Quebec for England. Among these were
many British-born, instant in response to the call to
arms, and peculiarly conscious of the danger which
threatened the mother country. It was natural that they
should predominate in the first Canadian contingent. If
there had been immediate danger to Canada, such as
that to which the old countries were exposed, the enlistment
of Canadians would have exceeded all other elements
of the population. But notwithstanding that the causes
of the war lay in Europe natives of Canada were numerous
in the first oversea regiments. Many of those who
enlisted as officers made great sacrifices. Many who
enlisted as privates made even greater sacrifices. They
abandoned responsible and remunerative positions and
the certainty of commissions if they had sought to avoid
service in the ranks. All put life at stake. In those
heroic battalions East and West, Quebec and Ontario,
were represented, and whether English-speaking or French
speaking they displayed valor and endurance in the field.</p>

<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>From month to month and from year to year the call
for men has been continuous and insistent. When we
had organized an army of 100,000 another 100,000 was
demanded. When 200,000 had enlisted there was an
appeal for 300,000. When 350,000 had enrolled a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Canadian contribution of 500,000 was authorized. By
voluntary enlistment 430,000 men were secured and
332,000 of these have crossed the sea. In all the long
span of human history there is nothing more romantic
and majestic than this great gift of manhood from the
new world to restore freedom in the old. Even when the
bells ring for peace many of those who left Canada in the
pride of youth and strength will not come back. The loss
is grievous even though they were where they should have
been when they fell. The casualties in the Canadian
army exceed 100,000 and 30,000 sleep in France and
Flanders. Many of those in the trenches have borne the
strain and shock of war for years, separated from wives
and children, from fathers and mothers, from all the
associations and interests which give normal life zest and
value. They have no obligation to country or Empire
which does not lie as clearly upon all of us. If we deny
the support which they need we shall be dishonored.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If ye break faith with us who die,</div>
<div class="verse">We shall not sleep though poppies grow</div>
<div class="indent">In Flanders’ fields.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>In Canada as in Great Britain we enrolled a great
army under the voluntary system. If it had been said a
few years ago that the Dominion could secure 400,000
men for a war in Europe the statement would have been
treated with derision. But the fact that voluntary
enlistment has been so satisfactory is an argument for,
not against, a compulsory draft. The need for selection
is more imperative. Such great sacrifices demand our
last effort to ensure that they shall not be in vain. The
magnitude of the enlistment emphasizes the danger and
the vital interest of Canada in the issue. It is admitted
by the authorities that in a few months all available reinforcements
will be exhausted. Appeal and persuasion
have ceased to bring any considerable response, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
not wholly without effect. There is no prospect of peace
in the near future. We must, therefore, gradually withdraw
from the war as our regiments become ineffective
fighting units or supply such fresh troops as will meet the
loss and wastage. There is no suggestion that fresh
troops should be withheld. Even those who oppose the
draft declare that adequate reinforcements must be provided.
It may be that compulsion would not have been
applied in Canada if voluntary recruiting could have been
maintained, but with comparative failure of voluntary
recruiting and little prospect of revival it is curious that
the draft should be opposed if the necessity for reinforcements
is admitted.</p>

<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p>In 1863 Lincoln prepared an opinion on the draft
for the Civil War in which he said, “At the beginning of
the war, and ever since, a variety of motives, pressing
some in one direction and some in the other, would be
presented to the mind of each man physically fit for a
soldier upon the combined effect of which motives he
would, or would not, voluntarily enter the service. Among
these motives would be patriotism, political bias, ambition,
personal courage, love of adventure, want of employment
and convenience or the opposites of some of these.
We already have, and have had in the service, substantially
all that can be obtained upon this voluntary weighing
of motives. And yet we must somehow obtain more
or relinquish the original object of the contest, together
with all the blood and treasure already expended in the
effort to secure it. To meet this necessity the law for
the draft has been enacted. You who do not wish to be
soldiers do not like the law. This is natural, nor does it
imply want of patriotism. Nothing can be so just and
necessary as to make us like it if it be disagreeable to us.
We are prone, too, to find false arguments with which to
excuse ourselves for opposing such disagreeable things.
In this case, those who desire the rebellion to succeed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
others who seek reward in a different way, are very active
in accommodating us with this class of arguments.” He
added, “The republican institutions and territorial integrity
of our country cannot be maintained without the
further raising and supporting of armies. There can be
no army without men. Men can be had only voluntarily
or involuntarily. We have ceased to obtain them voluntarily,
and to obtain them involuntarily is the draft—is
conscription. If you dispute the fact, and declare that
men can still be had voluntarily in sufficient numbers,
prove the assertion by yourselves volunteering in such
numbers and I shall gladly give up the draft. Or if any
one of you will volunteer he for his single self will escape
all the horrors of the draft and will thereby do only what
each one of at least a million of his manly brothers have
already done. Their toil and blood has been given as
much for you as for themselves. Shall it all be lost
rather than that you, too, will bear your part? I do
not say that all who would avoid serving in the war are
unpatriotic, but I do think every patriot should willingly
take his chance under a law made with great care in order
to secure entire fairness.”</p>

<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p>The situation that Lincoln describes is very much the
situation in Canada. The blood that was shed by
valiant Canadians at Ypres, and Givenchy and Festubert
and on the Somme, at Vimy Ridge and before Lens,
will have been shed in vain if an inglorious peace is
imposed upon Britain and her Allies and the German
people strengthened in allegiance to a dynasty which will
vex mankind with its pretentions, conspiracies and infamies
until it is destroyed. Moreover, as long as Germany
has power to fill the earth with apprehension
Governments will continue their eager competition in
armaments and high expenditures for defence. The
war is for safety as well as for freedom, and upon its result
the free institutions of Canada depend. If it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
unanimous judgment of Parliament that Canada should
enter the war, and if among the people there was universal
approval of the action of Parliament, how can we withdraw
until victory is achieved? How can we continue
in the war unless we can maintain and reinforce the
regiments in the field? How can we get men except by
command of the State when the persuasion of the State
has ceased to be effective? There are those who talk
wildly about “driving men to slaughter.” But more
than 400,000 of the sons of Canada have driven themselves
to “slaughter,” and because they have done so
our homes and institutions have been secure.</p>

<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>The Military Service Act only requires that those among
us who can best be released from the occupations in which
they are now engaged shall serve in the field under conditions
as honorable as surround their fellow Canadians in uniform
and under regulations no more onerous or exacting. The
Militia Act as amended in 1906 provided that the Government
could place the militia “on active service anywhere
in Canada and also beyond Canada for the defence thereof
at any time when it appears advisable so to do by reason
of emergency.” Enough has been said to reveal an
emergency in which nothing less fundamental is at stake
than the existence of Canada as a free country. If
Germany should triumph we would not have a choice
between Independence and British Connection. We
would pass under German sovereignty. There would
be no protection under the Monroe Doctrine. If Germany
should not be conquered the United States, in
arms against the Germanic alliance, would be involved
in the common defeat of the Allies. Washington would
be as powerless as London or Ottawa to determine the
future political status of the Canadian people. Recalling
the desperate valor of Canadian soldiers in many battles
with the best troops of Germany, is it likely that Ontario<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
or Quebec or any other Canadian province would escape
the hard fate of Alsace and Lorraine or receive a greater
portion of mercy than the harassed Polish subjects of the
Kaiser? Clearly, therefore, the Canadian regiments are
as surely defending Canada in France and Flanders as
though they were actually resisting invasion along the
St. Lawrence.</p>

<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p>By the Militia Act it was provided that “if at any
time enough men do not volunteer to complete the
quota required the men liable to serve shall be drafted
by ballot.” Chiefly because of this provision the Militia
Act was amended or superseded by the Military Service
Act. It was manifest that selection by ballot would
continue and multiply the inequalities produced by
voluntary recruiting. Occupations and industries embarrassed
by scarcity of labor would suffer still further,
and physical fitness for war would be the general test of
eligibility. It was, therefore, declared that “by reason
of the large number of men who have already left agricultural
and industrial pursuits in Canada to join the Expeditionary
Force as volunteers, and of the necessity of sustaining
under such conditions the productivity of the
Dominion, it is expedient to secure the men still required,
not by ballot, as provided in the Militia Act, but by
selective draft.” Other provisions of the Act divide the
available manhood of the country into six classes ranging
in age from 20 to 45 and subject to selection according to
military necessity, number of dependents and order of
physical fitness.</p>

<h3>XXII.</h3>

<p>Under national service “conscript” has no invidious
meaning. It is expunged from the language. As Lincoln
said, failure to volunteer does not necessarily imply want
of patriotism. Who has the right to judge his neighbor?
Who fully understands his neighbor’s position? If we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
think of our school days we will recall the boys who had a
natural instinct for fighting. We will think, too, of those
who shrank from rough physical encounters, and were
almost suspected of actual cowardice. But how often in
emergencies those under suspicion of cowardice revealed
courage and daring at least equal to their more pugnacious
comrades. They would, perhaps, be the last to join a
volunteer fire brigade but, if occasion required, they
would fight a fire as courageously and resolutely as their
adventurous associates. The new regiments to go forward
under the Military Service Act will perform deeds of
valor equal to any that have glorified Canadian arms.
There will be Military Crosses for many of those who
found it hard to decide between private and public duty.
“I will give unto this last even as unto thee.”</p>

<h3>XXIII.</h3>

<p>Under national service the State calls all its manhood
to arms but relieves from odium and suspicion all those
who can better serve its interests on the farms, in the
factories, or in other necessary civil activities. The
Military Service Act of Canada, as has been said, was
passed by Parliament in obedience to a general public
demand and in assertion of the Government’s deliberate
conviction that only by selective draft could the necessary
reinforcements for the army in France be obtained and
the orderly continuance of production and industry
assured. In the machinery for applying and enforcing
the measure there are ample safeguards against partiality,
injustice or partisanship. The Military Service
Council has been constituted to advise and assist in the
administration and enforcement of the Act. The Deputy
Minister of Justice is the chairman of the Council, and
the other members have been chosen equally from the
two great political parties. The advice of the Council is
sought in order to ensure that the Act will be administered
with just and equal regard to the interests of all classes of
the community, and in all questions affecting the draft,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
requiring the consideration of the Governor General or the
Minister of Justice, the conclusions will be reached in consultation
with the Council. Moreover, the provincial
registrars and the local tribunals receive instructions from
the Council as to the manner in which their duties are to
be discharged; and, while the local tribunals exercise their
judicial functions with perfect independence, so far as
concerns the determination of individual cases, they may
nevertheless refer to the Council for direction or advice
upon general questions of doubt or difficulty. Provincial
tribunals, chosen from the judiciary of the various provinces,
are provided for resort by those who are dissatisfied
with decisions of the local tribunals; and, in order to
ensure uniform treatment of claims for exemption, as
well as sympathetic and consistent consideration alike of
local and national conditions, an ultimate appeal is
authorized to Mr. Justice Duff, a distinguished member
of the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>

<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<p>The scruples of those belonging to recognized religious
denominations which forbid military service will be
respected. All those whose services in the occupations
in which they are now engaged, whether agricultural,
industrial or commercial, are essential to the national
interest or whose business or domestic responsibilities
are so onerous that serious hardship would result if they
were enrolled, are entitled to conditional exemption.
There is, however, no provision that any occupation or
industry shall be absolutely exempted. Each individual
claim for exemption must be considered on its merits, but
the general dispositions of the law are such as to ensure
that civil occupation will compete successfully with
military service in any case in which it is established that
the withdrawal of the man from his civil occupation would
materially diminish the output or production, or seriously
impair the service necessary for the maintenance or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
efficiency of the expeditionary force, or for the support of
the people at home. It will readily be perceived, having
regard to this principle, that the supply of useful farm
labor must not be substantially diminished since food
production is so vital not only to the inhabitants of
Canada, but to the armies, to Great Britain and to the
allied countries within the actual area of war; and also
because the volume of exports must be maintained, for
upon these greatly depend the national revenues and
the ability of the Dominion to provide credits for the
mother country. More and more increasingly Britain’s
purchases in Canada will be measured by the amount of
credit that Canada can supply. The huge war burdens of
Britain, and the immense obligations assumed for
the allies have strained her financial resources; and in
proportion, therefore, as we can afford relief, we will
render service secondary in importance only to reinforcement
of the army.</p>

<h3>XXV.</h3>

<p>There is reason to believe that the selective draft will
operate with greater equality than has distinguished
voluntary recruiting in the townships. Doubtless there
are farms from which the only son has gone to the Front,
while from other farms the men who could have gone
have exercised the option which they had to remain at
home. Such inequalities will be avoided under the
draft system, and the men will be taken who can best be
spared. If in any occupation, be it that of the farmer,
the miner, the skilled artisan or the mechanic, there
be men available for military service who for the
present are not needed in their ordinary pursuits, these
will be required to serve; but it will be the duty
of the tribunals, as much to uphold a natural title to
exemption, as to reject a claim which cannot compatibly
with the national interest be established. Professional
and literary men as well as men employed at manual
occupations, and those engaged in directing them, may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
seek exemption by reason of the importance to the community
of the work in which they are habitually engaged
and which would in a material degree remain undone if
they were taken. The State will first seek those who have
no dependents, but the fact that a young man is unmarried
will not be conclusive evidence against his
exemption. He may hold a position for which he has
peculiar qualifications, and in which his service is essential
to the prosperity or comfort of the community. It is not
possible to review here the various considerations which
may arise with respect to individuals engaged in different
callings each presenting questions peculiar to itself, but
it is intended that in all cases the tribunals shall afford
protection and assume the task, be it difficult or otherwise,
of relieving an applicant from the anxiety of an embarrassing
personal decision. No doubt there are many young
men in Canada who should not have waited until compelled
to serve, but there are also thousands who have
chafed and fretted because they could not enlist, and
whom it would be grossly unjust to describe as “slackers”
or “shirkers.” Reflection upon these considerations
emphasizes the defects of the voluntary system and
suggests the essential justice and fairness of national
service.</p>

<h3>XXVI.</h3>

<p>The first call will be for men between the ages of 20
and 34, who are unmarried or are widowers without
children, and all belonging to this class must within the
period limited by the proclamation report for service or
apply for exemption from service. Convenient arrangements
have been made, and notified to the public, whereby
these reports and applications may be submitted through
the post without loss of time or expense to the persons
who are required to report or apply. Medical boards
have been established at convenient centres for determining
the physical qualifications of all men within the
class. It is advisable that each man affected by the call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
should make up his mind as to whether he will report for
service or apply for exemption and promptly act in
accordance with his resolution. No possible advantage,
either in obtaining exemption or as to the time for entering
upon active service, will be gained by delay; on the
contrary, a man who delays may suffer some unnecessary
inconvenience and loss of time in the attendance which
will be required, if his report or application be postponed
until near the expiration of the period defined by the
proclamation. The importance of immediate appearance
before the Medical Boards which will sit at every centre
of mobilization is apparent. Until men have undergone
medical examination they cannot know whether or not
their services will be required. Certificates of physical
unfitness from the Medical Boards will be accepted by
the exemption tribunals without further investigation.
But anyone dissatisfied with the decision of a Medical
Board may nevertheless invoke the judgment of the
tribunals upon his physical condition. Under the provisions
of the Act only 100,000 men can be drafted. The
Militia Department is anxious that only those of undoubted
physical fitness shall be accepted. Unfit men
reduce the efficiency of the army and become charges
upon the country while still equal to civil duties. The
Medical Boards, therefore, are under as great obligation
to reject the unfit as they are to declare the soundness of
any who may seek to escape by misrepresenting their
physical condition. It is not suggested that there will be
many cases of evasion or misrepresentation. We have
had so many examples of persistent and even pathetic
endeavor by those of doubtful physical vigor to enlist
that the Medical Boards will have to guard against the
unfit rather than to exercise vigilance against deceit and
imposition.</p>

<h3>XXVII.</h3>

<p>It has been said that failure to volunteer does not
necessarily imply want of patriotism, but it will be hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
to find any decent excuse for men who neglect to register
under the Military Service Act. There is assurance of
consideration for those in difficult circumstances. There
is certainty of exemption for adequate reasons. Failure,
therefore, to respond to the State’s appeal will imply
want of patriotism and expose the recalcitrants to compulsion
in its ancient and more odious significance. The
Government cannot be partial towards individuals or
classes or communities. There is no provision for the
purchase of substitutes such as unfortunately occurs in
the Canadian Militia Act of 1906, and which constituted
a flagrant defect in the draft as applied in the American
Civil War. Rich and poor are on a common level. Equal
in citizenship, from all equal service and sacrifice are
required. As reinforcements are needed those who have
been found liable and fit for service will receive notice to
report at the nearest mobilization centre. Neglect of the
summons will expose offenders to a maximum sentence of
five years’ imprisonment at hard labor. Nor will any
civil punishment relieve such offenders from the performance
of their military duties. All sentences will be
imposed ordinarily by the civil magistrates but in cases
of refusal or wilful neglect to report for duty the military
authorities may inflict the severe penalties due to
deserters.</p>

<h3>XXVIII.</h3>

<p>A direct obligation rests upon employers to assist
the registration tribunals. They will fail in patriotism
and public spirit unless they encourage those in their
service to enroll. They will fail as surely if they demand
exemption for employees of military age and physical
fitness who can be released without serious detriment to
the enterprises with which they are connected or who are
connected with enterprises of inconsiderable national
significance. It is assumed that in many cases applications
for exemption will be made by employers or by relatives
rather than by those liable to military duty. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
evidence of employers that men are indispensable in their
civil occupations will generally be necessary to secure
favorable judgment. In Great Britain many employers
furnished lists of those whom they desired to retain and
appeared on their behalf before the tribunals. No doubt
this will also be the general practice in Canada, although
the right of personal appeal must be regarded as proper
and absolute. There will be those whose circumstances
peculiarly justify exemption for whom no one else can
appeal. While the great and immediate object is to
secure reinforcements for the expeditionary forces, selection
without injustice to individuals or unwise interference
with essential industries is the definite duty and
obligation of the tribunals.</p>

<h3>XXIX.</h3>

<p>In Great Britain there has been much controversy
and some anger over the “disabilities of conscience.”
Men have been found willing to fabricate “conscientious
scruples.” Of these an official under the Military Service
Acts justly speaks with severe reprobation, and he
emphasizes “the bitterness with which a man who is
required to leave wife, children and livelihood, and does
so with a quiet dignity of which I have been a respectful
witness in hundreds of cases, regards a conscientious
objector, remaining at home and enjoying the fruits of
other men’s sacrifices.” He accepts religious objection
to combatant service as legitimate ground for exemption,
but would require from such objectors the performance
of other duties which war creates. Conscientious objections
are apt to emerge as the demand for men becomes
more searching and opportunities for escape from military
service upon other grounds become more remote. And,
in order to guard against imposition, since “having in
your mind is nothing, for it is common learning that the
thought of man is not triable,” conscientious objection
has been made a ground of exemption in Canada only for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
those who belong to some well recognized religious denomination
which forbids combatant service by the articles
of its faith in effect when the Military Service Act was
passed. Those who are able <i>bona fide</i> to place themselves
in this category escape upon statutory grounds.
It would be unwise and unjust if this were not so. But
while religious objection is a lawful ground for exemption,
it affects combatant service only, and such objectors
who enjoy the privileges, although refusing the duties
required of the ordinary citizen, remain liable for any
other branch of the national service.</p>

<h3>XXX.</h3>

<p>If employers co-operate heartily and unselfishly with
the tribunals any unnecessary delay in registering for
medical examination and exemption will be avoided.
The selective draft tests the patriotism of all classes. An
employer who denounces “shirkers” and yet seeks to
hold men who are not essential to his business is as deaf
to the appeal from the trenches as he who would evade
the call to the colors. If men of means and position,
who by reason of age or other circumstances are not
subject to the draft, refuse to sacrifice convenience or
profit for flag and country, how can they ask other men
to risk life itself? It is not suggested that employers
should practise intimidation or coercion, but only that
they should require their staffs to register and discourage
dubious petitions for relief. We may not regard sacrifice
as the exclusive duty and privilege of soldiers. Men
may not live, write and speak as though the war had no
relation to themselves or as though they knew no higher
duty than to exploit the apprehensions, anxieties and
miseries inseparable from war for selfish, personal advantage.
There cannot be war without sacrifice for all
elements and interests, and he is the best patriot who
bears inevitable losses and distresses with fortitude and
by word and example maintains the spirit and unity of
the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<h3>XXXI.</h3>

<p>No greater effort is required from Canada than from
the other nations whose freedom and independence are
assailed. If we falter we betray those who have “borne
the battle” for us. We cast the splendor of their sufferings
and sacrifices in shadow forever. They loved peace
as much as we do. Life was as dear to them as it is to us.
They cherished the ties of home and family just as we do.
They had affections as intimate and obligations as sacred
as any that we feel or know. If they are deserted shame
will be our portion in history. It will be said that the
honor they won for us among the nations we meanly
cast away and that we were unworthy of their chivalry,
courage and sacrifice. We cannot escape comparison
with Britain and Australia and New Zealand. If we
deny obligation to the Empire or responsibility for the
war we are still subject to judgment. At least we have a
political connection with the Old World which the United
States has not, and, therefore, cannot withdraw from a
conflict into which our neighbors have entered through
high concern for the decencies of civilization and the
elementary rights of mankind. To-day we command the
world’s respect and keep our own. To lose either would
be to barter decency, dignity and glory for ease, discredit
and humiliation.</p>

<h3>XXXII.</h3>

<p>If ever there was a struggle to keep men’s faces turned
towards the sun it is this in which we are engaged. Never
were free men so bound to enforce the decree that they
who take the sword shall perish by the sword. If we
fail now the earth will enter upon a long era of unrest
and tumult for it is inconceivable that the nations which
are withstanding the German assault will ever surrender
control over their own destinies whatever be the cost in
life and money now or in the future. We must also
remember how Germany makes war and steel ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
to suffer and endure until the despots who would master
the world are driven out of the lands they have seized
and defiled and beaten into submission. In “The Retreat
from Mons,” by Major A. Corbett Smith, there is this
passage: “We have seen from the very beginning that
‘chivalry’ and ‘fair play’ are words unknown to the
Germans. To them nothing matters but to win, preferably
by foul means. So, on the very first day, British
soldiers were terribly undeceived. They saw German
infantry advancing to the attack behind a screen of
Belgian women and children, driven on at the bayonet
point. From then onward we lost hundreds of gallant
men simply through their feelings of humanity towards
wounded enemies, being shot at by other Germans, or
being treacherously shot or stabbed by the very men to
whose lips they were holding a flask of water. And yet,
with such examples before them of their comrades’ fate,
the sense of humanity and chivalry was never dulled.
Despite the stringent orders on the subject, the men,
even now, hesitate to fire when the enemy raises a white
flag, and will always, whenever possible, succor a wounded
German lying before the trench. These are the men who
have only, as yet, learned of German treachery by hearsay
evidence. But there are others. There are companies
and battalions who know from ghastly experience.
These men adopt other methods.”</p>

<h3>XXXIII.</h3>

<p>Major Corbett Smith continues: “But nothing I can
write will make people at home understand what this war
really is. Nothing short of actual experience can do that.
Stay, perhaps there is one thing; the genius of Louis
Raemaekers. He, at least, by his cartoons, is bringing
home to millions the hideous meaning of this war. And
not only of this war, but of all modern war. I would
have a volume of his cartoons distributed gratis by the
Government to every household in the kingdom. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
would have half a dozen of the cartoons thrown upon the
screen in every cinema-house at every entertainment.
The people would shudder with horror, but they would
see them and learn what Germany is and what war means.
Apart from this, I hold it to be the sacred duty of every
man and woman who can use a pen to advantage, or who
can command the attention of an audience, to make
known this meaning. To cry from the housetops what
is this foul thing which Germany has thrust upon the
world, and to show the people why and how Civilization
must crush it out for ever. There is no greater honor
to-day that a man may wear—alas, there are but few
left to wear it!—than the honor of having served his
King and Country in France throughout August and
September, 1914. Just that. He needs no decoration,
no ‘mention.’ He served through the ‘Retreat from
Mons.’ In days to come our children, our children’s
children, will point with pride to that one little word on
the regimental color, ‘Mons.’ For in that single word
will be summed up the liberation of the world. It was
the victory of the Marne which won for Civilization
that freedom, but it was, under God’s hand, the British
Navy, the stand of Belgium, and the ‘Retreat from Mons’
which made that victory possible.”</p>

<h3>XXXIV.</h3>

<p>But the victory for freedom has not yet been fully
won. The foe, in turn, retreats but he contests every
foot of ground, and the advance of the allies is as costly
as it is glorious. In this advance the soldiers of Canada
have fought as bravely as their comrades of Britain,
France, Belgium and Australia. They call for the reinforcements
which the draft will supply in confidence
that we at home are as jealous for the reputation of
Canada as they, and as determined to prosecute the war
until complete victory is achieved. The call comes
from those who gave themselves in answer to our appeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
They are not asking to be taken out of the trenches.
They do not seek consideration or relief for themselves.
They ask only that the gaps in their ranks shall be filled
and we who sent them away to guard our honor and
protect our institutions cannot do less than resolve that
the response to their appeal shall be speedy and adequate.
It may be that the day is still remote “when peace shall
over all the earth her ancient splendors fling,” but somewhere
in the distance there is a hilltop bathed in the sunshine
of victory and radiant with the glory of the morning.
